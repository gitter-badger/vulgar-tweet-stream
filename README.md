#  Auto Commit
==============

An erlang app that auto commits/pushes to a repo every day so you can have a good streak without doing anything remotely close to real work #workHardToHardlyWork

#### What does it do?
  * Writes to a file called commits.txt (or makes it if it doesn't exist)
  * Adds in the date/time of the next push. #complex
  * commits and then pushes it to master of whatever repo you point it at on your computer

#### What does this give you?
  * Github groupies
  * A girlfriend
  * dirty looks from real programmers

```sh
	erl <yadda yadda>
```
